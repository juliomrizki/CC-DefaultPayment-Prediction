# CC-DefaultPayment-Prediction

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a credit card holder is likely to default on their
payments. This information can be valuable for credit card issuers, as it can help them to identify high-risk
customers and take steps to minimize the financial impact of defaulted loans.
